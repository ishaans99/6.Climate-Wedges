# Climate-Wedges

This is an app I developed in MATLAB with Jacob Haddad and Daniel Paulo-Wach, wherein we explored and visualised the possible effects of manmade activities on CO2 levels in the atmosphere in the future. Furthermore, we investigated the climate stabilisation wedges strategy proposed by Pacala and Socolow, and explored and visualised how we can take charge in mitigating the effects of climate change by implementing different mitigation strategies ie. wedges, or some combination thereof. Beyond the basic features, we added more advanced functionality to allow the different interested parties to experiment with different mitigation strategies and constraints.

Note to run the app, a wedge file must be submitted in .txt format.
