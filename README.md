# Climate-Wedges

This is an app I developed in MATLAB with Jacob Haddad and Daniel Paulo-Wach, wherein we explored and visualised the possible effects of manmade activities on CO2 levels in the atmosphere in the future. Furthermore, we explored the climate stabilisation wedges strategy proposed by Pacala and Socolow, and explored and visualised how we can take charge in mitigating the effects of climate change by implementing a wedge (or some combination thereof).

Note to run the app, a wedge file must be submitted in .txt format.
