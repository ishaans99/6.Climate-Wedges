# Climate-Wedges

This is an app I developed in MATLAB with Jacob Haddad and Daniel Paulo-Wach, wherein we explored and visualised the possible effects and consequences of manmade activities on CO2 levels in the atmosphere in the future. Furthermore, we investigated the climate stabilisation wedges strategy proposed by Pacala and Socolow, and explored and visualised how we can take charge in mitigating the effects of climate change by implementing different stabilising strategies ie. wedges across a variety of industries. Beyond the basic features, we added more advanced functionality to allow interested parties to experiment with different mitigation strategies which obeyed pre-specified constraints. More details are available in `App Report.pdf` regarding app functionality, infrastructure, and UI.

Note that to run the app, a wedge file must be submitted in .txt format. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like to use this app for individual or educational purposes.
